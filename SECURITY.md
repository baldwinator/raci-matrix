# Security Documentation

## Overview
This RACI Matrix application implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized to remove potentially malicious HTML tags and JavaScript
- **Input Length Limits**: 
  - Names: 100 characters max
  - Descriptions: 500 characters max
  - Categories: 50 characters max
  - Email addresses: 254 characters max (RFC standard)
- **Email Validation**: Proper regex validation for email format
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensures all inputs match expected data types

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented in `index.html` with strict policies:
  - `default-src 'self'`: Only allow resources from same origin
  - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: Scripts only from same origin (inline needed for Vite)
  - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: Styles only from same origin
  - `img-src 'self' data: https:`: Images from same origin, data URLs, and HTTPS
  - `font-src 'self'`: Fonts only from same origin
  - `connect-src 'self'`: Network requests only to same origin

### 3. HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Prevents spam and abuse with built-in rate limiter
- Limits: 10 actions per minute per action type
- Applies to: Adding tasks, adding team members
- User-friendly error messages when limits are exceeded

### 5. Local Storage Security
- **Secure wrapper** around localStorage operations
- **Size limits**: 5MB maximum to prevent storage abuse
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when storage fails
- **Data validation**: Validates data structure before loading
- **Sanitized keys**: All storage keys are sanitized

### 6. Data Validation
- **Server-side style validation** for all data structures
- **Type checking** for all inputs
- **Required field validation**
- **Fallback to sample data** if stored data is corrupted

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Uses HTTPS by default (automatic SSL)
- Static hosting reduces attack surface
- No server-side code execution
- Automatic security updates through GitHub

### Recommended Additional Measures

#### For Production Use:
1. **Authentication**: Add user authentication for multi-user environments
2. **Database Security**: If upgrading to shared storage, use encrypted connections
3. **Audit Logging**: Track user actions for compliance
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Backup Strategy**: Regular data exports for business continuity

#### For Enterprise Deployment:
1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integrate with company authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels
3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
4. **Network Security**: Deploy behind corporate firewall
5. **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance if handling personal data

## Vulnerability Prevention

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ✅ Input sanitization removes HTML tags and JavaScript
- ✅ Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts
- ✅ React's built-in XSS protection through JSX

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- ✅ No server-side state changes (client-side only app)
- ✅ SameSite cookie policies (when cookies are used)

### Clickjacking
- ✅ X-Frame-Options header prevents embedding
- ✅ CSP frame-ancestors directive

### Data Injection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Type checking for all data structures
- ✅ Length limits on all inputs

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents spam
- ✅ Storage size limits prevent memory exhaustion
- ✅ Input length limits prevent large payloads

## Incident Response

### If Security Issue is Discovered:
1. **Immediate**: Remove or disable affected functionality
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Inform users if data may be compromised
4. **Fix**: Implement and test security patch
5. **Deploy**: Update application with fix
6. **Monitor**: Watch for similar issues

### Reporting Security Issues
- Create a GitHub issue with "Security" label
- Include detailed description and reproduction steps
- Do not include sensitive information in public issues

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks:
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Check for new security advisories
- [ ] Test input validation with edge cases
- [ ] Review access logs (if available)

### Quarterly Tasks:
- [ ] Security audit of code changes
- [ ] Review and update CSP policies
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Update security documentation

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy:
- Application stores data locally on user devices
- No data transmitted to external servers
- Users control their own data
- Easy data export and deletion

### GDPR Compliance:
- Right to access: Users can export their data
- Right to rectification: Users can edit their data
- Right to erasure: Users can clear their data
- Data portability: Export functionality available
